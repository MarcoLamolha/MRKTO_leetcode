    "Approach 1: Cycle Detection with Extended Paths\n",
    "Intuition\n",
    "From the overview, the problem boils down to identifying cycles in the directed graph, determining how chains can be connected, and ensuring that employees are seated next to their favorites.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement this, we first need to create a graph that represents the relationships between people based on their favorite person. This is done by constructing a reversed graph where each person points to the people who have them as their favorite. This structure allows us to easily trace back to the people that lead into each person’s chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we iterate through the graph nodes. If a node hasn’t been visited, we start a traversal, tracking visited nodes and the distance from the start using a map.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a node is visited during the traversal, we've detected a cycle. The cycle length is the difference in the distances at which we first encounter and revisit the node.\n",
    "A cycle length greater than 2 forms a self-contained group, which we compare with the largest cycle found.\n",
    "When we detect a two-node cycle (mutual favorites), the approach changes slightly. In this case, the cycle itself only accounts for two people, so we look for the longest chains that lead into both people of the cycle. This is done by implementing a BFS function that explores the reversed graph and finds the maximum path leading into each of the two nodes forming the cycle. The length of the chain for each node is determined by how far we can trace back in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we know the longest chain for each of the two nodes, we calculate the total size of the group by adding the two chain lengths plus 2 (for the two people in the cycle itself). This extended group size is then added to the total count of two-node cycle groups.\n",
    "Finally, the result is the larger of the largest standalone cycle or the largest extended group from the two-node cycle. This ensures the largest valid seating arrangement is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm\n",
    "Initialize a variable n to store the size of the favorite array, and create a reversedGraph to store the reversed edges (in this case, favorite relationships).\n",
    "\n",
    "Build the reversed graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterate through each person in the favorite array, and for each person, add them to the reversed graph using favorite[person] as the key.\n",
    "Define a helper function bfs to perform breadth-first search:\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialize a queue to hold the node and its distance.\n",
    "Process each node in the queue and explore its neighbors (reverse of the favorite relationship).\n",
    "Track the maximum distance during BFS and return this value after all nodes have been visited.\n",
    "Initialize longestCycle to keep track of the length of the longest cycle found.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialize twoCycleInvitations to store the count of invitations for cycles of length 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterate through each person in the favorite array:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the person hasn't been visited, start detecting a cycle from that person:\n",
    "Use a map visitedPersons to track the distance from the current node.\n",
    "Traverse through the favorite relationships to detect cycles.\n",
    "If a cycle is detected, calculate its length and update longestCycle.\n",
    "If the cycle length is 2, calculate invitations from both nodes of the cycle by performing BFS from each node, ensuring that both nodes are marked as visited.\n",
    "Return the maximum of longestCycle and twoCycleInvitations."
